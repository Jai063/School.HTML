  <h1>Rome</h1>

  <div class="country-content">
    I want to visit Rome for its elegance and timeless beauty. 
    The architecture, art, and historical monuments represent 
    centuries of culture and refinement.

    Seeing the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Vatican City 
    would allow me to experience one of the greatest civilizations 
    in history.

    I would also enjoy authentic Italian pasta, pizza, and gelato 
    while walking through beautiful cobblestone streets.
