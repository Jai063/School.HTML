    <h2>Tutorial of my life</h2>
    <p>
        <sup>1</sup>Carl’s childhood began with curiosity and a tendency to wander both physically and mentally. 
        <sup>2</sup>One defining moment occurred when he got lost on a crowded beach as a young child. 
        <sup>3</sup>He walked along the shore for nearly half an hour, calling out for his parents. 
        <sup>4</sup>Although fear slowly crept in, he refused to stop moving. 
        <sup>5</sup>Instead of breaking down, he observed the world around him. 
        <sup>6</sup>During that search, Carl noticed a small fish stranded on the wet sand. 
        <sup>7</sup>The fish struggled to breathe, which immediately caught Carl’s attention. 
        <sup>8</sup>Feeling sympathy, he carefully picked it up with his small hands. 
        <sup>9</sup>He walked toward the waves and released the fish back into the ocean. 
        <sup>10</sup>Watching it swim away filled him with pride and relief. 
        <sup>11</sup>Not long after, his father finally found him. 
        <sup>12</sup>His father’s reaction was a mix of fear and overwhelming relief. 
        <sup>13</sup>Carl, however, appeared calm and unfazed. 
        <sup>14</sup>He was covered in sand from running around the beach. 
        <sup>15</sup>As a child, he was playful and energetic. 
        <sup>16</sup>That playful nature sometimes led to trouble at school. 
        <sup>17</sup>Once, he made a classmate cry by throwing a pencil case too hard. 
        <sup>18</sup>Despite mistakes, Carl always showed kindness afterward. 
        <sup>19</sup>He had a good heart and strong imagination. 
        <sup>20</sup>Those early experiences shaped his sense of empathy and creativity.

    <h2>Mastered the controls</h2>
    <p>
        <sup>1</sup>During his teenage years, Carl became a restless explorer of interests. 
        <sup>2</sup>He joined multiple sports teams to see where he might belong. 
        <sup>3</sup>Basketball was the first sport he seriously tried. 
        <sup>4</sup>Although he enjoyed it, the passion did not last. 
        <sup>5</sup>He later attempted volleyball but felt disconnected from it. 
        <sup>6</sup>Music became another area of exploration. 
        <sup>7</sup>Carl learned to play several instruments during this time. 
        <sup>8</sup>He practiced guitar and gradually improved his skills. 
        <sup>9</sup>Despite progress, he felt it was still not enough. 
        <sup>10</sup>Drawing also interested him for a short period. 
        <sup>11</sup>However, inconsistency prevented mastery. 
        <sup>12</sup>Carl continued moving from one hobby to another. 
        <sup>13</sup>This pattern made him question his abilities. 
        <sup>14</sup>Others described him as a <span class="highlight">jack of all trades</span>. 
        <sup>15</sup>While he accepted the label, it caused self-doubt. 
        <sup>16</sup>He wondered if he would ever find his true calling. 
        <sup>17</sup>Despite confusion, he never stopped trying new things. 
        <sup>18</sup>His imagination remained active throughout these years. 
        <sup>19</sup>He constantly created stories in his head. 
        <sup>20</sup>Those imaginative thoughts quietly prepared him for his future path.

    <h2>Heavier difficulty</h2>
    <p>
        <sup>1</sup>College marked a turning point in Carl’s life. 
        <sup>2</sup>He finally pursued Computer Science, a long-held dream. 
        <sup>3</sup>At the beginning, he felt motivated and confident. 
        <sup>4</sup>As lessons progressed, the difficulty increased. 
        <sup>5</sup>The workload demanded discipline and time management. 
        <sup>6</sup>Carl struggled to keep up during his first year. 
        <sup>7</sup>Despite his effort, he failed one subject. 
        <sup>8</sup>The failure deeply frustrated him. 
        <sup>9</sup>However, it also humbled him. 
        <sup>10</sup>He realized effort alone was not enough. 
        <sup>11</sup>Instead of quitting, he chose to retake the subject. 
        <sup>12</sup>He promised himself to improve. 
        <sup>13</sup>Carl began managing his time more carefully. 
        <sup>14</sup>He practiced more consistently. 
        <sup>15</sup>He also learned to ask for help when needed. 
        <sup>16</sup>This mindset shift strengthened him. 
        <sup>17</sup>Failure became a lesson rather than an ending. 
        <sup>18</sup>College slowly matured his character. 
        <sup>19</sup>His commitment to his dream grew stronger. 
        <sup>20</sup>Above all, Carl focused on becoming the best version of himself.
