  <div class="country-content">
    I want to visit Spain because of its rich history and vibrant culture. 
    The country carries strong historical influence through architecture, 
    art, and tradition.

    Exploring Barcelona, Madrid, and historical landmarks such as 
    La Sagrada Familia would allow me to see history blended with creativity.

    I would also like to try paella, churros, and experience traditional 
    Spanish festivals.
