  <h1>Japan</h1>

  <div class="country-content">
    I want to visit Japan mainly because of its legendary car culture. 
    From the underground street racing scenes in Tokyo to iconic tuning culture, 
    Japan is home to some of the most respected automotive engineering in the world. 
    Experiencing car meets, visiting tuning shops, and seeing classic JDM cars in 
    real life would be a dream.

    Beyond cars, Japan offers incredible places such as Tokyo, Kyoto, and Mount Fuji. 
    The mix of futuristic cities and traditional temples creates a unique balance 
    between modern and historical beauty.

    I also want to try authentic ramen, sushi, takoyaki, and wagyu beef.
