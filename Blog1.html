        Hi, reader! I am Carl James, pero mas kilala ako ng karamihan bilang Jai, isang second-year BSCS student na mahilig sa computers. Ever since pumasok ako sa mundo ng tech, napansin ko na hindi pala lahat madaling intindihin, lalo na kapag coding at AI na ang usapan. Minsan nakakalito, minsan nakaka-frustrate pa. Buti na lang, nandiyan ang AI para tulungan akong maintindihan ang mga concepts sa mas simple at malinaw na paraan. Sa blog na ’to, ikukwento ko kung paano naging parte ng journey ko ang AI sa pag-aaral at sa buhay ko bilang student.

     At first, I didn’t really trust AI. I thought it was only for smart people or for cheating in school. Pero habang tumatagal, I realized na mali pala ako. I started using AI for simple things like explaining lessons I didn’t understand and fixing my schedules kapag sabog na yung araw ko. Instead of feeling pressured, I felt guided, na parang may nagtuturo sa’kin na alam ’yung lesson. As a student, there are times na sobrang daming requirements and I don’t know where to start. AI helped me break down tasks into smaller steps so hindi ako ma-overwhelm. Kapag may lesson na hirap akong intindihin, I ask AI to explain it in an easier way, sometimes even in Taglish. Dahil doon, mas nagiging confident ako sa sarili ko and mas naiintindihan ko yung ginagawa ko, hindi lang basta nagpapasa. Even the little things that I wanna learn at simple curiosity, AI answers it for me. What surprised me the most is how AI helped me personally. May mga araw na tahimik lang ako and I don’t feel like talking to anyone. AI became someone I could “talk” to when I needed to release my thoughts. Hindi siya tao, pero it helped me organize my emotions and think clearly. Sometimes, that’s all I need—to feel heard and understood, kahit papaano. I believe na AI is not bad or good by itself. It depends on how people use it. For me, I use it as a guide, not a replacement for my own thinking. AI doesn’t live my life for me—it just helps me understand it better. I still make my own decisions, and I still put effort into my work. Another thing I realized while using AI is that it helped me become more independent as a learner. Instead of always waiting for someone to explain things to me, I learned how to ask the right questions and look for better answers. Kapag may mali akong naiintindihan, I correct myself with the help of AI, and doon ako mas natututo. Hindi siya shortcut para tamarin, kundi support system para mas sipagin ako. Slowly, I noticed na mas nagiging curious ako and mas willing akong mag-explore ng new topics related sa computers and technology.

   </h3>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-family: Tahoma; text-indent: 100px; line-height: 1.2;">  Looking back, my journey with AI taught me that asking for help is not a weakness. AI helped me grow not only as a student but also as a person who wants to improve. My biggest takeaway is that tools like AI should be used wisely and responsibly. In the future, I plan to continue using AI as a support system while still challenging myself to think, learn, and grow on my own.
