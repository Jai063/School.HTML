  <h1>New Zealand</h1>

  <div class="country-content">
    I want to visit New Zealand to calm my mind and experience 
    its breathtaking natural landscapes. The country looks like 
    something out of a fantasy world.

    The mountains, lakes, and green fields create a peaceful 
    atmosphere that feels far from stress and noise.

    Visiting places such as Queenstown and exploring hiking trails 
    would allow me to reconnect with nature and reset mentally.
