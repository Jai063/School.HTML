    <h1>B.B.T.Y</h1>

<h2>It's me again reader</h2>
<p>
Hi, I’m Jai Asonto, 2nd year college student sa BSCS. 
Palagi akong curious sa computers, coding, at technology. 
Kinuha ko tong course para to enhance my skills at and learn more about my passion. 
This blog is my space to share my journey, struggles, and mindset ko sa college life.
</p>

<h2>Let's beging the talk</h2>
<p>
College life talaga rollercoaster. Araw-araw may bagong challenges, deadlines, at tests. 
May mga moments na feeling ko sobra na, parang hindi ko kaya. 
I failed a subject too, pero natutunan ko, na failure is not the end of my life, it's part of the process.  
<br><br>
Ang importante, paano ka babangon after bumagsak. 
Natuto akong maging patient at persistent, at minsan magjoke lang para ma-lighten ang stress. 
May mga gabi late nang tulog dahil debugging o assignments, nakakapagod, pero worth it.  
<br><br>
Nakakakilala ako ng mga cool na tao sa college friends na nagtutulungan at classmates na inspiring. 
We share ideas at minsan rant lang about how tough college is. 
Na realize ko, that you also really need someone to study with, so they can help you.
<br><br>
Despite lahat ng hirap, I noticed some changes in myself. improved skills sa coding, I built some muscle memories, time management, at nadiscover yung true passion ko. 
Sometimes I doubt myself, but reminder ko sa sarili ko, growth is a process at hindi productive ang i-compare sarili sa iba.  
<br><br>
My goal is simple <p5><b><i>be better than yesterday.</b></i></p5>
Kahit slow ang progress o may stumble, hindi ako susuko. 
Natuto rin akong i-celebrate ang small victories at hindi hayaan na setbacks define me.  
<br><br>
 college is not just about academics. Dito ko na-discover kung sino ako at limits ko. 
May mga araw na stressed o anxious ako, pero natutunan ko to cope with music or walking to clear my mind. 
Every challenge teaches me resilience at patience.  
</p>

<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>
This personal blog is a snapshot ng journey ko bilang student at tao. 
Failures won’t stop me—they’ll make me stronger at mas prepared. 
Goal ko keep improving, keep learning, at never stop moving forward. Whatever happens, keep going and Be Better Than Yesterday.
